 <br><br><br> <p class="span"><span class="adjust" id="apj">APJ Abdul Kalam</span></p>
<p style="font-family: monospace; font-size:x-large">Avul Pakir Jainulabdeen Abdul Kalam was an Indian aerospace scientist and statesman who served as the 11th president
     of India from 2002 to 2007.
      He was born and raised in Rameswaram, Tamil Nadu and studied physics and aerospace engineering. He spent the next four decades as a 
      scientist and science administrator, mainly at the Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) and Indian Space Research 
      Organisation (ISRO) and was intimately involved in India's civilian space programme and military missile development efforts.
       He thus came to be known as the Missile Man of India for his work on the development of ballistic missile and launch vehicle 
    technology.He also played a pivotal organisational, technical, and political role in India's Pokhran-II nuclear tests in 1998,
        the first since the original nuclear test by India in 1974.</p>

    <p style="font-family: monospace; font-size: x-large;">Kalam was elected as the 11th president of India in 2002 with the support of both the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party and the then-
    opposition Indian National Congress. Widely referred to as the "People's President",he returned to his civilian life of education, 
    writing and public service after a single term. He was a recipient of several prestigious awards, including the Bharat Ratna, 
    India's highest civilian honour.
    
    While delivering a lecture at the Indian Institute of Management Shillong, Kalam collapsed and died from an apparent cardiac 
    arrest on 27 July 2015, aged 83.Thousands, including national-level dignitaries, attended the funeral ceremony held in his 
    hometown of Rameswaram, where he was buried with full state honours.

      <p style="font-family: monospace; font-size: x-large;">Avul Pakir Jainulabdeen Abdul Kalam was born on 15 October 1931, to a Tamil Muslim family in the pilgrimage centre 
        of Rameswaram on Pamban Island, then in the Madras Presidency and now in the State of Tamil Nadu. 
        His father Jainulabdeen Marakayar was a boat owner and imam of a local mosque his mother Ashiamma was a housewife.
         His father owned a ferry that took Hindu pilgrims back and forth between Rameswaram and the now uninhabited Dhanushkodi.
          Kalam was the youngest of four brothers and one sister in his family.
          His ancestors had been wealthy Marakayar traders and landowners, with numerous properties and large tracts of land. 
          Marakayar are a Muslim ethnic group found in coastal Tamil Nadu and Sri Lanka who claim descent from Arab traders and local women.
           The family business had involved trading groceries between the mainland and the island and to and from Sri Lanka, 
           as well as ferrying pilgrims between the mainland and Pamban. With the opening of the Pamban Bridge to the mainland in 1914,
            however, the businesses failed and the family fortune and properties were lost by the 1920s, apart from the ancestral home.
             The family was poverty-stricken by the time Kalam was born. As a young boy he had to sell newspapers to add to the family's 
             meager income.</p>

      <p style="font-family: monospace; font-size: x-large;">  In his school years, Kalam had average grades but was described as a bright and hardworking student who had a strong desire to learn
        . He spent hours on his studies, especially Mathematics. After completing his education at the Schwartz Higher Secondary School, 
        Ramanathapuram, Kalam went on to attend Saint Joseph's College, Tiruchirappalli, then affiliated with the University of Madras, 
        from where he graduated in physics in 1954.
        He moved to Madras in 1955 to study aerospace engineering in Madras Institute of Technology.
        While Kalam was working on a senior class project, the Dean was dissatisfied with his lack of progress 
        and threatened to revoke his scholarship unless the project was finished within the next three days. 
        Kalam met the deadline, impressing the Dean, who later said to him, "I was putting you under stress and asking you to meet 
        a difficult deadline."He narrowly missed achieving his dream of becoming a fighter pilot, 
        as he placed ninth in qualifiers, and only eight positions were available in the IAF.</p>

<h1><i>REPRESENTING INDIA as a SCIENTIST</i></h1>
<center><div class="c"><img src="C:\Users\palak\OneDrive\Desktop\project pics\apj5.jpg" style=" height:300px; width: 500px;"></div></center><br>
<div><p style="font-family:monospace; font-size: x-large;"> graduating from the Madras Institute of Technology in 1960, Kalam joined the Aeronautical Development Establishment of the Defence 
    Research and Development Organisation (by Press Information Bureau, Government of India) as a scientist after becoming a member of the 
    Defence Research & Development Service (DRDS). He started his career by designing a small hovercraft, but remained unconvinced by his 
    choice of a job at DRDO. Kalam joined the INCOSPAR, working under Vikram Sarabhai, the renowned space scientist. He was interviewed
     and recruited into ISRO by H. G. S. Murthy, the first Director of Thumba Equatorial Rocket Launching Station (TERLS).</p>
    <p style="font-family:monospace; font-size:x-large;">In 1963 to 1964, he visited NASA's Langley Research Center in Hampton, Virginia; Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, 
        Maryland; and Wallops Flight Facility.Between the 1970s and 1990s, Kalam made an effort to develop the Polar Satellite 
        Launch Vehicle (PSLV) and SLV-III projects, both of which proved to be successful.</p>
    <p style="font-family:monospace; font-size:x-large;">Kalam was invited by Raja Ramanna to witness the country's first nuclear test Smiling Buddha as the representative of TBRL, even 
        though he had not participated in its development. In the 1970s, Kalam also directed two projects, Project Devil and Project
        Valiant, which sought to develop ballistic missiles from the technology of the successful SLV programme. Despite the 
        disapproval of the Union Cabinet, Prime Minister Indira Gandhi allotted secret funds for these aerospace projects through
         her discretionary powers under Kalam's directorship.Kalam played an integral role convincing the Union Cabinet to 
         conceal the true nature of these classified aerospace projects. His research and educational leadership brought him 
         great laurels and prestige in the 1980s, which prompted the government to initiate an advanced missile programme under his 
         directorship. Kalam and Dr V S Arunachalam, metallurgist and scientific adviser to the Defence Minister, worked on the 
         suggestion by the then Defence Minister, R. Venkataraman on a proposal for simultaneous development of a quiver of missiles 
         instead of taking planned missiles one after another. R Venkatraman was instrumental in getting the cabinet approval for
          allocating ₹ 3.88 billion for the mission, named Integrated Guided Missile Development Programme (IGMDP) and appointed Kalam
           as the chief executive. Kalam played a major part in developing many missiles under the mission including Agni, 
           an intermediate range ballistic missile and Prithvi, the tactical surface-to-surface missile, although the projects have been
            criticised for mismanagement and cost and time overruns.</p></div>
     <p style="font-size:xx-large; ">Presidentship</p>      
     <div><p style="font-family:monospace; font-size:x-large; ">Kalam served as the 11th president of India, succeeding K. R. Narayanan. He won the 2002 presidential election with an electoral
        vote of 922,884, surpassing the 107,366 votes won by Lakshmi Sahgal. His term lasted from 25 July 2002, to 25 July 2007.</p>
       <p style="font-family:monospace; font-size: x-large;">On 10 June 2002, the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) which was in power at the time, expressed that they would nominate Kalam
            for the post of President, and both the Samajwadi Party and the Nationalist Congress Party backed his candidacy. After
             the Samajwadi Party announced its support for Kalam, Narayanan chose not to seek a second term in office, leaving the field 
             clear. Kalam said of the announcement of his candidature:</p>
           <center><h2><a href="C:\Users\palak\OneDrive\Desktop\project pics\apj6.avif"><p>"I am really overwhelmed. </p>
             <p> Everywhere both in Internet and in other media, I have been asked for a message.</p>
             <p >I was thinking what message I can give to the people of the country at this juncture."</p></a></h2></center>
            <p style="font-size:x-large; font-family: monospace; ">During his term as president, he was affectionately known as the People's President, saying that signing the Office of 
                Profit Bill was the toughest decision he had taken during his tenure.Kalam was criticised for his inaction in deciding the
                 fate of 20 out of the 21 mercy petitions submitted to him during his tenure. Article 72 of the Constitution of India
                  empowers the President of India to grant pardons, and suspend or commute the death sentence of convicts on death row.
                Kalam acted on only one mercy plea in his five-year tenure as president, rejecting the plea of rapist Dhananjoy Chatterjee,
                 who was later hanged.Perhaps the most notable plea was from Afzal Guru, a Kashmiri terrorist who was convicted of conspiracy
             in the December 2001 attack on the Indian Parliament and was sentenced to death by the Supreme Court of India in 2004.
              While the sentence was scheduled to be carried out on 20 October 2006, the pending action on his mercy plea resulted in him
               remaining on death row.He also took the controversial decision to impose President's Rule in Bihar in 2005.

                In September 2003, in an interactive session in PGI Chandigarh, Kalam supported the need of Uniform Civil Code in India,
                 keeping in view the population of the country.
                
                At the end of his term, on 20 June 2007, Kalam expressed his willingness to consider a second term in office provided there
                 was certainty about his victory in the 2007 presidential election.However, two days later, he decided not to contest the Presidential 
                 election again stating that he wanted to avoid involving Rashtrapati Bhavan from any political processes. He was proposed
                 by third front named United National Progressive Alliance leader J. Jayalalithaa and coordinator Chandrababu Naidu other leaders
                  Mulayam Singh Yadav and Om Prakash Chautala, but he did not have the support of the left parties, Shiv Sena and UPA constituents
                  , to receive a renewed mandate.</p></div>   <div id="layout">

<div><p style="font-size:x-large; font-family: monospace;">Kalam received 7 honorary doctorates from 40 universities. The Government of India honoured him with the Padma Bhushan in 1981
     and the Padma Vibhushan in 1990 for his work with ISRO and DRDO and his role as a scientific advisor to the Government. In 1997, 
     Kalam received India's highest civilian honour, the Bharat Ratna, for his contribution to the scientific research and modernisation
      of defence technology in India. In 2008 Kalam was the recipient of Hoover Medal. And in 2013, he was the recipient of the Von
       Braun Award from the National Space Society "to recognize excellence in the management and leadership of a space-related project".
</p>
   <p style="font-size:x-large; font-family: monospace;"> In 2012, Kalam was ranked number 2 in Outlook India's poll of the Greatest Indian.</p>
    
  <p style="font-size:x-large; font-family: monospace;">Following his death, Kalam received numerous tributes. The Tamil Nadu state government announced that his birthday, 15 October,

 <div><p style="font-size:x-large; font-family: monospace;"> One of the best speeches of Mr. Kalam was the one he gave in the European Union in the year 2007. emphasized on the runner,
     Kaniyan Poongunranar’s belief that he was a world citizen and every citizen was his own kith and kin. Mr. Kalam said that where 
     there is righteousness in the heart, there is beauty in the character.  there is beauty in the character, there is harmony 
     in the home. When there is harmony in the home, there is order in the nation. When there is order in the nations, there is peace
      in the world. These heart-touching lines touched the souls of all the EU members present there.</p>
    <p style="font-size: x-large; font-family: monospace;">In one of his speeches at the Indian Institute of Technology, Madras in 2010, he shared his experience with the 11 million
         young people he had come across in a decade’s time. He said that every youth wants to be unique and that is YOU. But the world
          around us is striving every day to make you a common person. Being like everyone else is not at all satisfying in the long run. 
          People tend to regret that they couldn’t be unique and achieve greater heights in life. Dr Abdul Kalam envisioned before the
           batch of students the perspective of the ‘Evolution of the unique YOU'.</p>
        <p style="font-size: x-large; font-family: monospace;">Dr Kalam always insisted the younger generation to work with their full heart towards anything that they wanted to achieve.
             He said that one might achieve success while having worked with half-heart but bitterness keeps breeding all the time. 
             He is remembered by the younger generation as one of those leaders who gave them a safer and brighter India coupled with
              economic and social growth. He believed in the importance of a father, mother, and teacher in the nurturing of a 
              corruption-free India as these are the people who develop the country’s future.</p></div>

<h2><b>KALAM </b> as a <b>COMMON MAN</b></h2>
<div><p style="font-family:monospace; font-size: x-large;"> Namaz and fasting during Ramadan were integral to the life of Kalam, a practising Sunni Muslim.
    <br>His father, the imam of a
    mosque in his hometown of Rameswaram, had strictly instilled these Islamic customs in his children. 
    <br>His father had also impressed upon the young Kalam the value of interfaith respect and dialogue. As Kalam recalled:
     "Every evening, my father A. P. Jainulabdeen,an imam, Pakshi Lakshmana Sastry, the head priest of the Ramanathaswamy Hindu temple, and a church priest used to sit with hot tea 
      and discuss the issues concerning the island."
       Such early exposure convinced Kalam that the answers to India's multitudinous
       issues lay in "dialogue and cooperation" among the country's religious, social, and political leaders.Moreover, since Kalam 
       believed that "respect for other faiths" was one of the key cornerstones of Islam, he was fond of saying: "For great men, religion 
       is a way of making friends; small people make religion a fighting tool."</p>
    <p style="font-family:monospace; font-size: x-large;">One component of Kalam's widespread popularity among diverse groups in India, and an enduring aspect of his legacy, is the 
        syncretism he embodied in appreciating various elements of the many spiritual and cultural traditions of India.In addition to his 
        faith in the Quran and Islamic practice, Kalam was well-versed in Hindu traditions; he learnt Sanskrit, read the Bhagavad Gita
        and he was a vegetarian. Kalam also enjoyed writing Tamil poetry, playing the veena (an Indian string instrument), and
         listening to Carnatic devotional music every day. In 2002, in one of his early speeches to Parliament after becoming president,
          he reiterated his desire for a more united India, stating that "during the last one year I met a number of spiritual leaders of all
           religions ... and I would like to endeavour to work for bringing about unity of minds among the divergent traditions of our country".
         Describing Kalam as a unifier of diverse traditions, Congress leader Shashi Tharoor stated, "Kalam was a complete Indian, an 
         embodiment of the eclecticism of India's heritage of diversity". BJP leader L. K. Advani concurred that Kalam was "the best 
         exemplar of the Idea of India, one who embodied the best of all the cultural and spiritual traditions that signify India's unity in
          immense diversity. This was most strikingly evident in the second-to-last book he published, presciently titled Transcendence: My 
          Spiritual Experiences with Pramukh Swami".</p></div>

    <h2> AUTO-BIOGRAPHY</h2>      
    <div><p style="font-family: monospace; font-size: x-large;"><a href="C:\Users\palak\OneDrive\Desktop\Wings_of_Fire_by_A_P_J_Abdul_Kalam_Book_Cover.jpg"> Wings of Fire (1999)</a>, is
         the autobiography of the Missile Man of India and President of India, Dr. A. P. J. Abdul Kalam.It was written by him and
          Arun Tiwari.
        In the autobiography, Kalam examines his early life, effort, hardship, fortitude, luck and chance that eventually led him to lead
         Indian space research, nuclear and missile programs. Kalam started his career, after graduating from Aerospace engineering at
          Madras Institute of Technology, at Hindustan Aeronautics Limited and was assigned to build a hovercraft prototype. Later he moved
           to ISRO and helped establish the Vikram Sarabhai Space Centre and pioneered the first space launch-vehicle program. During the 
           1990s and early 2000, Kalam moved to the DRDO to lead the Indian nuclear weapons program, with particular successes in
            thermonuclear weapons development culminating in the operation Smiling Buddha and an ICBM Agni.</p>
        <p style="font-family: monospace; font-size: x-large;">The book begins with the childhood of Kalam's life. In the beginning, he introduces us to his family and tries to familiarize
             us with his birthplace Rameswaram. In childhood, he was a great admirer of his father, Jainulabdeen. He was a man of great
              wisdom and kindness, and Pakshi Lakshmana Sastry, a close friend of his father and the head priest of the Rameswaram Temple.
               He had an ideal helpmate in his mother, Ashiamma. He was also influenced by his close friend, Ahmed Jalaluddin; he was about
                15 years older than Kalam. With his friend, he talked about spiritual matters. This shows that he believed in spirituality 
                and also believed in God or Khuda. He always went to Lord Shiva's temple with his friends.</p>
            <p style="font-family: monospace; font-size: x-large;">In the later part of the opening chapters, he introduces his cousin Samsuddin, his school teachers, and all the people who
                 have felt any difference amongst them. Here he expresses one event, which happened in his school days, a new teacher at 
                 his school, could not stomach a Hindu Priest's son sitting with a Muslim boy. In accordance with our social ranking as the
                  new teacher saw it, I was asked to go and sit on the backbench. I felt very sad, and so did my parents about the incident.
                   Lakshmana Sastry summoned the teacher, and in our presence, told the teacher that he should not spread the poison of 
                   social inequality and communal intolerance in the minds of innocent children".</p></div>
    <h2>DEATH</h2>
    <div id="bottom"><p style="font-family: monospace; font-size: x-large;">On 27 July 2015, Kalam travelled to Shillong to deliver a lecture on "Creating a Livable Planet Earth" at the Indian
         Institute of Management Shillong. While climbing a flight of stairs, he experienced some discomfort, but was able to enter 
         the auditorium after a brief rest. At around 6:35 p.m. IST, only five minutes into his lecture, he collapsed. He was rushed to 
         the nearby Bethany Hospital in a critical condition; upon arrival, he lacked a pulse or any other signs of life. Despite being
          placed in the intensive care unit, Kalam was confirmed dead of a sudden cardiac arrest at 7:45 p.m. IST. His last words, to his
           aide Srijan Pal Singh, were reportedly: "Funny guy! Are you doing well?"</p>
        <p style="font-family: monospace; font-size: x-large;">Following his death, Kalam's body was airlifted in an Indian Air Force helicopter from Shillong to Guwahati, from where it was 
            flown to New Delhi on the morning of 28 July in an air force C-130J Hercules. The flight landed at Palam Air Base that afternoon
             and was received by the President, the vice-president, the Prime Minister, Chief Minister of Delhi Arvind Kejriwal, and the
              three service chiefs of the Indian Armed Forces, who laid wreaths on Kalam's body. His body was then placed on a gun carriage
               draped with the Indian flag and taken to his Delhi residence at 10 Rajaji Marg; there, the public and numerous dignitaries
                paid homage, including former prime minister Manmohan Singh, Congress President Sonia Gandhi and Vice-president Rahul
                 Gandhi, and Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav.</p>
            <p style="font-family: monospace; font-size: x-large;">On the morning of 29 July, Kalam's body, wrapped in the Indian flag, was taken to Palam Air Base and flown to Madurai in
                 an air force C-130J aircraft, arriving at Madurai Airport that afternoon. His body was received at the airport by the 
                 three service chiefs and national and state dignitaries, including cabinet ministers Manohar Parrikar, Venkaiah Naidu,
                  Pon Radhakrishnan and the governors of Tamil Nadu and Meghalaya, K Rosaiah and V. Shanmuganathan. After a brief 
                  ceremony, Kalam's body was flown by air force helicopter to the town of Mandapam, from where it was taken in an army 
                  truck to his hometown of Rameswaram. Upon arriving at Rameswaram, his body was displayed in an open area in front of 
                  the local bus station to allow the public to pay their final respects until 8 p.m. that evening.</p></div>
